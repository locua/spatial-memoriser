* Requirements
** Software
- Linux 64bit recommended. Built and tested on Ubuntu 18.04. Should work on windows and macOS but not all the functionality will work such as adjusting camera settings from within the application.
- [[https://openframeworks.cc/download/][openFrameworks]]. Was developed on version *v20200211_linux64gcc6_nightly*
- [[https://www.mankier.com/1/v4l2-ctl][v4l2-ctl]]. The v4l2-ctl tool is used to control video4linux devices. If using on macOS or Windows use a supported application to adjust camera settings.
- [[https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxXmlSettings/ofxXmlSettings/][ofxXmlSettings]]. An openFrameworks xml interface
- [[https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxGui/][ofxGui]]. Gui Library for oF
- [[https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv][ofxCv]]. Alternative approach to interfacing with OpenCv from openFrameworks.
- opencv 4. May work with earlier versions as well.
** Hardware and physical setup
- Projector. With at least 1500 lumens
- 1080p webcam and extened usb.

* Setup / install

For use the camera ID will most likely have to change. After initial compilation
check the output for the ID of camera.

#+begin_src c++
// camera and window setup
int camId = 0; // Change this variable to the correct id
#+end_src

* Controls / keyboard shortcuts
All these shortcuts are run on the GUI window. Except =f= which can be run on
either window to toggle fullscreen.

- Toggle tracking with =t=
- Toggle corners on projection window with =c= key
- Toggle chequerboard on projection window with =C= key
  - Useful for keystone calibration
- Reset camera settings to default with =r=
- Toggle zoom mode with =z=
  - Doesn't work in a useful way
- Increment and decrement exposure with =+= and =-=
  - Only works if v4l2-ctl is installed 
- Toggle fullscreen with =f=
- Save settings with =s=
